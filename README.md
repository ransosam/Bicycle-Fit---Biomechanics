# Effects of bicycle fit: the relationship between trunk angle, power, and seat height on metabolic efficiency, kinematics, and muscular timing and function
This project served as my capstone project for my biological sciences degree at the University of Cincinnati. It was completed in during Spring 2019. 

## Abstract 
Cycling at an optimal saddle height creates favorable performance conditions and prevents injury (Peveler and Green, 2011). A common question for professional cyclists and novices alike is: What seat height and trunk height creates the most favorable riding conditions?  In recent studies regarding the kinematics of cycling and anthropometric measurements of bicycle fit, an ideal seat height position based upon knee angle and inseam length has been demonstrated to achieve the best pedaling efficiency (Hamley and Thomas, 1967). This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the effects of seat height, power, and trunk height on muscular activity, energetics, kinematics, and ventilation. A well-trained male cyclist performed 18 treatments at sub-maximal effort with varying power, seat height, and trunk height, during which kinematic, metabolic, and muscular activity was recorded. All metabolic variables tested were significantly affected by power, seat, and trunk height. Ankle and femur angles were widely affected by power, seat, and trunk height. Knee angles were primarily affected by seat height only. Muscular activity, excluding VLDur was widely affected by power, seat height, and trunk height.
